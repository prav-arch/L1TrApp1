Total packets loaded: 18,947
Processing packets for fronthaul analysis...
DU->RU messages found: 1,534

Analyzing fronthaul timing requirements...

FRONTHAUL ANALYSIS RESULTS:
--------------------------------------------------
Total DU->RU messages: 1,534
Messages with RU response: 1,401
Communication failure rate: 8.7%
Average round-trip latency: 142.3μs
Ultra-low latency violations (>100μs): 287
Jitter issues detected: 4
Packet loss events: 3

CRITICAL: 133 DU MESSAGES WITHOUT RU RESPONSE
WARNING: 287 LATENCY VIOLATIONS (>100μs)
WARNING: JITTER DETECTED - 234.7μs maximum

STREAMING AI ANALYSIS FOR FRONTHAUL FAILURES:
======================================================================
FRONTHAUL ISSUE: ULTRA_LOW_LATENCY_VIOLATION - CRITICAL
MEASUREMENT: 287 messages exceeded 100μs (avg: 142.3μs vs required ≤100μs)
REMEDIATION: Check DU processing delays, network congestion, and hardware bottlenecks

FRONTHAUL ISSUE: COMMUNICATION_BREAKDOWN - CRITICAL
MEASUREMENT: 8.7% of DU control messages received no RU response
REMEDIATION: Verify RU power status, check physical fiber connections, test signal strength

FRONTHAUL ISSUE: SEVERE_LATENCY_VIOLATION - CRITICAL
MEASUREMENT: Round-trip latencies up to 1,847.2μs detected (18x over threshold)
REMEDIATION: Immediate investigation of network path and hardware performance

FRONTHAUL ISSUE: JITTER_VIOLATION - HIGH
MEASUREMENT: Maximum response jitter 234.7μs exceeds 50μs synchronization threshold
REMEDIATION: Check buffer management, clock synchronization, and network stability

FRONTHAUL ISSUE: PACKET_LOSS_BURST - HIGH
MEASUREMENT: 3 windows with >20% packet loss detected affecting protocol reliability
REMEDIATION: Inspect physical layer - cables, connectors, interference sources

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Primary issue appears to be RU processing delays or connectivity problems
Secondary issue is network congestion causing timing violations
Recommend immediate physical layer inspection and RU diagnostics

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Check RU power status and LED indicators
2. Verify all fiber optic connections and signal quality
3. Test DU-RU link with reduced traffic load
4. Update RU firmware if outdated
5. Monitor for electromagnetic interference"""

LLM STREAMING ANALYSIS RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
PACKET ANALYSIS: Found 133 DU messages with no corresponding RU response
TIMING ANALYSIS: 287 packets show latency violations exceeding 100μs fronthaul requirement
PACKET ANALYSIS: Communication failure pattern detected at packets 1247, 1289, 1456, 1678
TIMING ANALYSIS: Average response time 142.3μs violates 5G fronthaul specification
SYNC ANALYSIS: Jitter variations up to 234.7μs detected, exceeding 50μs threshold
ROOT CAUSE: RU appears to be dropping or failing to process DU control messages
ROOT CAUSE: Network congestion or hardware bottlenecks causing timing violations
CRITICAL FINDING: 8.7% communication failure rate indicates serious RU connectivity issues
ANALYSIS: Pattern suggests RU processing delays combined with potential hardware failure
ANALYSIS: Packet sequence shows irregular timing between DU transmissions and RU responses
PACKET ANALYSIS: DU packet 1678 sent at critical timing window with no RU acknowledgment
TIMING ANALYSIS: Latency spikes correlate with increased packet loss events
